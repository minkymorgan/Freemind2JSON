Pupose:

Freemind to JSON xslt export conversion, tailored to Protovis use.

Notes:

Use this xsl snippet for exporting data from Freemind to JSON using the Freemind export via XSLT menu.
The output is compatable with the import format needed for Protovis
Any questions I can be reached on @minkymorgan on twitter.
			
Fee based support for this software is available from the author. 
If interested, please enquire.

Usage:

1) In freemind, create a taxonomy with a root of a single word (no spaces).
2) Populate the taxonomy.
3) Do not decorate the taxonomy using fancy graphics, or use special characters
as these are likely to break the conversion process.
4) Via the Freemind application menus, select File/Export/Using XSLT
5) in the popup window for "select xsl file" browse to the freemind2json_v0_01.xsl file you downloaded to your computer 
6) in the popup window for "chose output file" create a output.js file accessable to protovis
7) in your protovis html, reference the output.js file, to feed data to your visualisation 
	    <script type="text/javascript" src="output.js"></script>
8) in a modern browser open your visualisation
